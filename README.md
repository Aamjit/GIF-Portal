## Your Favourite GIF collection Portal

This Project was built using **ReactJS** as a front end Framework with some styling using CSS, some assets, some predefined GIFs. If you do no find the GIFs make sure you have a phantom wallet and connect the site using your wallet.
<br/>

As for the Backend I have used my **Phantom Account** to build the application on top of **Solana blockchain**. 

## Getting Started
There is a lot on how you can get started.
<br/>

If you are new to crypto and do not have a crypto wallet, rest easy my friend there is nothing to worry about. Follow the steps below it does not take anything and its simple.

_NOTE:_ Make sure you keep your security key safe cause you will need it if anything happens with your account.

1. First download Metamask [here](https://metamask.io/). Create a metamask Account through the extension.
> Metasmask is crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps. Using this we will create a Phantom acoount.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
